## Highlights

### Progressive Web App

Works offline by caching changes using Redux/localstorage and syncs them back to the API so employees can use the app while on the road.

### Custom form fields

Form fields for your usual text inputs and radio buttons along with more advanced types like groups, conditional fields, and repeatable sections.

### Custom Form validation

The unique nature of the form fields required building a Redux-based custom form validator that can check if required fields are filled out and formatted properly for email, phone, zip, and more.
