## Highlights

### Serverless Back-End

The API is built with the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) using Lambdas written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) that access the cocktail recipes stored in the NoSQL [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) database.

### Thorough search, filter, and sort capabilities

Allow the user to search, filter, and sort the recipes by ingredients the have on hand, base liquor, style, etc... to find the perfect drink they can make.

### Photo recognition (in-progress)

Allow users to take pictures of the liquor bottles they have on hand and use [Clarifai's](https://www.clarifai.com/) AI powered photo recognition to and add it to their local inventory on the phone.

### Testing

Tests created using [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking.
