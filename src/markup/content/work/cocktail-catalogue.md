## Highlights

### Thorough search, filter, and sort capabilities

Allow the user to search, filter, and sort the recipes by ingredients the have on hand, base liquor, style, etc... to find the perfect drink they can make.

### Photo recognition (in-progress)

Allow users to take pictures of the liquor bottles they have on hand and use [Clarifai's](https://www.clarifai.com/) AI powered photo recognition to and add it to their local inventory on the phone.

### Supabase Back-End

The backend uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) with custom MySQL functions for advanced queries.

### Testing

Tests created using [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking.
